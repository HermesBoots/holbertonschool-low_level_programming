# C - Binary Trees

## New Node
Add a new node to a tree without restriction.

## Insert Left
Add a new node as the left child of another node, maintaining its previous child.

## Insert Right
Add a new node as the right child of another node, maintaining its previous child.

## Delete
Delete an entire binary tree.

## Is Leaf
Check if a node in a binary tree is childless.

## Is Root
Check if a node is the root of a tree.

## Pre-Order Traversal
Call a function on every node in the tree in pre-order.

## In-Order Traversal
Call a function on every node in the three in-order.

## Post-Order Traversal
Call a function on every node in the tree in post-order.

## Height
Measure the height of a binary tree.

## Depth
Measure the depth of a node in a binary tree.

## Size
Count the number of nodes in a binary tree.

## Leaves
Count the number of childless nodes in a binary tree.

## Nodes
Count the number of nodes with children in a binary tree.

## Balance Factor
Compare the heights of the left and right branches of a node.

## Is Full
Check if every node in a tree has 0 or 2 children.

## Is Perfect
Check if every subtree is balanced and every node as 0 or 2 children.

## Sibling
Get the sibling of a node in a tree.

## Uncle
Get the uncle of a node in a tree.

## Lowest Common Ancestor
Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes.

## Level-Order Traversal
Call a function on all nodes in a tree in level-order.

## Is Complete
Check if tree as less than 2 nodes with 1 child and all subtrees are left-balanced.

## Rotate Left
Rotate a binary tree to the left once.

## Rotate Right
Rotate a binary tree to the right once.

## Is BST
Check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

## BST - Insert
Insert a new value into a binary search tree.

## BST - Array to BST
Create a new binary search tree containing all values from a given array.

## BST - Search
Search for a value in a binary search tree.
